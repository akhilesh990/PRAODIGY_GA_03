Markov Chain Text Generator

This project implements a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. The algorithm builds a statistical model from an input text corpus and generates new text based on learned word transitions.

Features

Accepts user-provided text corpus for training.

Allows user to choose the n-gram size (e.g., bigrams, trigrams).

Generates random text based on Markov chain probabilities.

User can specify the seed words and output length.
